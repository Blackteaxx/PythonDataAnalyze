They also had a whirlpool, so I had a soak in that one too. Here I noticed something strange about fluid dynamics: The bubbles were coming out of plastic plates that had tiny holes in them, probably compressed air that was guided through them, or something like that. Anyhow, whenever the bubbles came and I put my hand on the plate with the holes they came through, it felt really cold! It felt much colder than the normal air in the surrounding, so I thought to myself ""hmm, there must be some weird fluid dynamic effect that cools the whole thing down, and does so more when you put your hand onto it"", because the plate felt colder with my hand than without. Do you know of this effect? Could you maybe even explain it? Does it come up anywhere else, besides a whirlpool?",60,hey diana today public swim pool first time decad also whirlpool soak one notic someth strang fluid dynam bubbl come plastic plate tini hole probabl compress air guid someth like anyhow whenev bubbl came put hand plate hole came felt realli cold felt much colder normal air surround thought hmm must weird fluid dynam effect cool whole thing put hand onto plate felt colder hand without know effect could mayb even explain come anywher els besid whirlpool,0.872,176,0.375,-1.54271733,0.45914855,0.02917038

If I throw the same ball at the same velocity at a car traveling away at 0.9X velocity the ball will not break the window. The kinetic energy in the ball is the same, but less of it is transferred to the window.
 If the light red-shifts because we are moving away from the source (and it moves away from us), might not there be a similar case here? I know that light travels at light speed and thus time is different for it (stopped) but this explanation makes sense to me.",1,perhap miss someth let run thought experi take ball throw x veloc hard enough break car window know enough kinet energi caus said effect throw ball veloc car travel away 09x veloc ball break window kinet energi ball less transfer window light redshift move away sourc move away us might similar case know light travel light speed thu time differ stop explan make sens,0.935,144,0.403,-1.52604657,0.27431305,-0.04340714
