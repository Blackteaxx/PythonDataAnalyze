lowest : 'Aaron's Law' is just the beginning of a more exhaustive reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a law being used to prosecute Internet activist and hacker Aaron Swartz, said Democratic California Rep. Zoe Lofgren in an interview with Mashable.
"The statute, which was adopted in 1986, needs a whole, complete overhaul," Lofgren said in a phone interview. "But that's likely to take a very long time. So I'm very keen to work on a complete overhaul while on a parallel track, I'm hopeful we can make these discreet changes."
On Tuesday evening, Lofgren posted the one-page bill(opens in a new tab) on Reddit. Under her proposal, the violation of online terms of service would stop being a felony.
Some legal experts have said Lofgren's changes don't address what they see as other flaws of the CFAA. Lofgren is aware of those criticisms, but she wants to put this minor change ahead of more comprehensive reform. She's hoping this will take less time.
"I'm hopeful we can proceed promptly to make these discreet changes to prevent any other person from being tortured the way Aaron was," Lofgren said.
Lofgren's proposal, legal experts say, might come up short. They think that the main problem of the CFAA is that it lacks a clear definition of authorized access. Under the current law, prosecutors have a lot of leeway to charge hackers even in cases when all they did was get a hold of public information.
Lofgren knows of the limitations of the proposal. That's why she posted it on Reddit before introducing it to the House, looking for feedback and suggestions. "We're looking at what other elements could be included, if any, that would have basically prevented the indictment that Aaron faced," she said.
Swartz, a prominent Internet freedom activist, committed suicide on Friday, Jan. 11 in his Brooklyn apartment. At the time of his death he was awaiting trial for allegedly illegally downloading millions of scholarly articles over the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's network. He was facing up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.
His family, along with some of his friends and supporters, believe the charges against him, and an overzealous prosecution led by U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, contributed to his decision to commit suicide. A White House online petition to remove Ortiz reached 25,000 signatures on Tuesdsy. In response, Ortiz released a statement saying the conduct of her office was "appropriate" and that they never intended to ask for maximum sentence.
Lofgren refused to comment on the prosecution's behavior, arguing that that's not the role of a member of Congress, and instead went back to the CFAA.
"I'll just say this, if the statute allowed multiple felony charges to be lodged for what Aaron Swartz did, the statute should be changed," said Lofgren.

Lofgren has been at the forefront of Internet freedom issues in Congress for years, always involved -- and sometimes leading -- reforms that intended to tackle outdated laws on copyright, privacy and other Internet-related issues. She was one of the most prominent critics and opponents of the much-maligned Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and she thinks there's still much work to do. But for that, she says, the online community needs to step it up once more.
"The SOPA fight showed what can happen in terms of stopping bad legislation when people are armed with information and speak up to the legislator," she said, referring to the popular online uprising that led to Internet giants like Wikipedia and Google to join the protest. "The question is can people armed with information speaking to the legislator not only stop bad things from happening but make good things happen. And that's yet to be proven, we'll see."
Lofgren hopes that can turn out to be true in the following months, when she will introduce 'Aaron's Law' to the House, start working on an overhaul of the CFAA, domain seizure reform and re-introduce the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 2.0, which she introduced it(opens in a new tab) in late September. The aim of the bill is to introduce the same email privacy protections that were finally stripped out of the so-called Netflix bill, which passed at the end of the year.

Women (we've never seen any male booth babes) chosen for their looks are paid to hang around a company's booth and attract the mostly male, mostly older attendees.
Sometimes the women are well paid, sometimes they get minimum wage, but their relationship to the product in question is usually gossamer-thin.
We've seen some fairly egregious examples over the years, but none more so than the one our tech reporter Emily Price stumbled upon at CES in Las Vegas Thursday. Four women dressed in body paint and little else were displayed at a company's booth, like sculptures.
The women looked straight ahead with bored expressions, and were not allowed to interact with attendees. The company's own Instagram feed described them as "fembots."
It was not immediately clear how this display was supposed to relate to the product in question, a hard drive. We won't give the company the satisfaction of mentioning their name, but we have reached out to them (and the CEA) for comment.
After Emily posted the picture on Twitter, it received more than 350 retweets -- and many more outraged responses:
@emily(opens in a new tab) @thebloggess(opens in a new tab) How? What? Huh? I get it's Vegas, but this makes no bloody sense marketing-wise. Or as a reasonable human being.— Douglas Davidson (@ElmntsofMadness) January 11, 2013(opens in a new tab)

In the meantime, let us know in the comments what you think. It's 2013; is this an appropriate way to sell a tech product, or anything for that matter?

Lance Bass particularly has been vocal on Twitter and on his Dirty Pop radio show about not knowing the album was coming 12 years after the group split up (though the boy band memorably reunited last year an MTV Video Music Awards performance).
[seealso slug="lady-gaga-tony-bennett-jazz-album-cheek-to-cheek/"]
"No one knows about it, I didn't even know about it, OK?" Bass said. "[I found out] on Twitter. People were like, 'What is this?'" ... One CD is like all the hits and the other is all these random songs -- the stuff we did on Sesame Street, 'When You Wish Upon a Star' at Disney and all of these random songs we would record that hardly anyone heard. ... I remember recording them, but I've never heard them before. ... Our label didn't even tell us. None of us, none of us knew at all."
Sony Legacy, a branch of Sony Music Entertainment, released the compilation, and as Bass alluded to, the second disc is filled with the Sesame Street song, non-hits, covers and even country rock band Alabama's rendition of "God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You."

Meanwhile, the first disc includes the groups popular tracks such as "Tearin' Up My Heart," "Bye Bye Bye," "It's Gonna Be Me," "Pop," "Girlfriend," "Gone" and more.

Judging by the $2 million it just made at midnight showings, the movie appears headed for a stellar opening weekend of between $75 million and $100 million in ticket sales. Not bad for a $215 million film.
Disney has already hired a writer to pen a sequel to the prequel, according to the Hollywood Reporter(opens in a new tab). Which is a little odd, considering that this film ends by setting up the conditions for the 1939 Judy Garland movie; there seems little room for any more adventures.
The Oz franchise's future is assured -- if not necessarily with the same director.
"I doubt it, actually," is what Raimi told Mashable when asked if he'd consider a sequel. "I was attracted by this screenplay, not the [L. Frank] Baum books or anything else ... I hope the writers could find anything this beautiful."
The big question, then: Is it worth your time and investment? Will you find the story, as filmed, as beautiful as Raimi did? The answer largely depends on your definition of beauty.
Sound vs. Vision
If you're driven by the visual -- jaw-dropping landscapes, boundary-pushing CGI and surprisingly good 3D that won't give you a headache -- then yes, go see it with all deliberate speed.
If you're more motivated by the aural -- snappy dialogue, a good score and actors' delivery that really sells a believable fantasy world -- then not so much.
'Oz the Great and Powerful' spins an original tale (not based on the Baum books) of carnival magician Oscar Diggs (James Franco), whose stage name matches the movie title. Caught in a tornado at a black-and-white Kansas fair in 1905, he enters the colorful, widescreen land of Oz.
There he is immediately hailed as the great Wizard mentioned in prophecy, taken to the Emerald City, and enlisted to hunt down a wicked witch by her two sisters. Needless to say, all is not as it seems.
Diggs starts out as a thoroughly unlikeable womanizing huckster, and Franco took to the role with relish."I thought it was perfect," Franco tells Mashable. "I would get to play a comedic character in an epic setting."
Later on, driven by the love of a good witch and his sidekicks, Diggs suddenly becomes heroic, and this Franco finds harder to sell. To be fair, he doesn't have the greatest dialogue to work with. The character requires zingers; the script gives him weasel words and ponderous speeches.
One of these, a bedtime lecture on Thomas Edison, seems particularly jarring. We're supposed to think the inhabitants of Oz are ready to be wowed by electricity -- despite the fact that it takes place in a room lit by electric-like lamps, presumably powered by magic.
Unreality Is Broken
Likewise, the climactic battle requires you to accept that fireworks and a primitive kinetoscope are going to blow the minds of a populace that is totally used to flying monkeys and witches in soap bubbles. Not even Danny Elfman's most overblown, choir-filled score can paper over that one.
I spent much of the movie wishing I could suspend my disbelief, but questions like this kept cropping up. Where did Mila Kunis find her lipstick and leather pants? Why does Finley, the sidekick flying monkey voiced by Zach Braff, wear a bellhop outfit? Where did he come from, and what does he have to do with the evil flying monkeys?
Braff told me there's a deleted scene that explains all, but the whole Diggs-Finley relationship is poorer without it in the final film. There are a lot of strange choices like this; a lot of characters that take up too much screen time and don't quite gel.
'The Wizard of Oz' was explicitly supposed to be Dorothy's dream, which explained why the same actors were used in both the black-and-white and color sequences. 'Oz the Great and Powerful' is explicitly not a dream; we're supposed to accept Oz as real. Yet a few actors, or their voices, are still reused, and Diggs doesn't appear to notice.
Raimi's explanation? "In different dimensions, there are many similarities."
If you're not stopped by these questions, if you care mostly for how it all looks, you're in for a treat. In the countryside of Oz, each frame is packed with magical plants and creatures: zebra bees, white-haired squirrels, and bizarre dinosaur beings.
One CG character in particular is worth noting -- a girl made of porcelain, voiced by child star Joey King. Her cracked, reflective frame seems so fragile, so perfect, you don't pause to wonder how the eyes and mouth are moving on a piece of china.
Now that's how you suspend disbelief.
3D Or Not 3D?
When it comes to 3D, there are few movies that I feel absolutely must be seen that way. This is one of them. Raimi used to get headaches himself during 3D movies, so he "went to school" -- as he put it -- to learn the most up-to-date tricks and techniques for avoiding that outcome.
He also put a few easter eggs into the 3D version, specifically to reward viewers for shelling out the extra bucks on those glasses. You'll see them right at the start, in the black-and-white segment: a few things exit the squished frame, letting you know the widescreen is coming.
So there you have it: a film that is going to be successful no matter what, largely thanks to family audiences. It's filled with spectacular if not always believable optics, clunky dialogue, a score full of sound and fury that adds nothing, and odd holes in the script.
I would gladly catch it again sometime -- on a second screen, with the sound turned down.

 'Sup, bros? Apple debuted a new operating system at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday.
Before revealing the real name of the new OS X (Yosemite -- boooo-ring), Apple exec Craig Federighi joked that the development team considered another California-friendly name: OS X Weed.
The hashtag #OSXWeed quickly began a worldwide trending topic on Twitter, because, well, the Internet was made for weed jokes, Apple events and Game of Thrones spoilers.

highest: Zynga was full of surprises Thursday.
The social gaming company announced Q4 and year end financials on Thursday a full week ahead of schedule, but these numbers were somewhat overshadowed by an unexpected acquisition and plans for another round of layoffs.
[seealso slug="iphone-best-puzzle-games/"]
The layoffs, which will include more than 300 jobs (15% of the company's workforce), comes just seven months after Zynga unexpectedly laid off more than 500 employees back in June. The company shut down three offices alongside June's layoffs, and this round of layoffs will save the company "$33 to $35 million in pre-tax savings for 2014," according to the company's earnings release(opens in a new tab).
The acquisition announcement was sunnier news for the San Francisco-based company, which aims to continue its push into mobile gaming. Zynga announced the acquisition of mobile games developer NaturalMotion for $527 million, including nearly 40 million shares of Zynga stock. NaturalMotion was founded in 2001, has around 260 employees worldwide, and created games like Clumsy Ninja and the racing game CSR Classics.
"We believe that bringing Zynga and NaturalMotion together is the right step at the right time," said Zynga CEO Don Mattrick in a statement from the company's earnings release. "Our acquisition of NaturalMotion will allow us to significantly expand our creative pipeline, accelerate our mobile growth and bring next-generation technology and tools to Zynga that we believe will fast track our ability to deliver more hit games."
The kicker on Thursday was Zynga's financials, which beat Wall Street estimates despite a considerable dip from the same quarter last year. Zynga posted revenues of $176 million in Q4, down from $311 million in Q4 2012. For the year, Zynga revenue was $873 million, down from $1.28 billion in 2012.
Perhaps most alarming is Zynga's eroding user base. The company announced 27 million daily active users in Q4, down 12% from the DAU figure in Q3, and less than half the DAU total Zynga boasted in the same quarter last year.
As of 7:30 p.m. ET Thursday, Zynga stock(opens in a new tab) was up nearly 18% in after-hours trading on news of the acquisition, earnings, and cost cutting (layoffs).

Chief Operations Officer David Ko, Chief People Officer Colleen McCreary and Chief Technology Officer Cadir Lee are leaving amid an executive shuffle, Mattrick said in an email(opens in a new tab) to staff Tuesday.
The exits follow last month’s appointment of Mattrick, a former Microsoft(opens in a new tab) executive who replaced founder Mark Pincus and is seeking to reverse a 71% share slide since the company went public in December 2011. The new CEO is working to revive growth and reinvigorate Zynga’s efforts in mobile games. The company expects two to four quarters of “volatility” as Mattrick evaluates the business and products while developing a new strategy, he said on a conference call last month.
“We are taking layers out of the executive rank to get senior leaders closer to important product initiatives,” Mattrick wrote in Tuesday's email.
Through yesterday, Zynga had dropped 17% since announcing on July 25 that it’s abandoning plans to enter the online-gambling business in the U.S. The company also forecast third-quarter sales and earnings that fell short of analysts’ estimates as fewer users play games on Facebook(opens in a new tab)'s website. Zynga fell less than 1% to $2.90 at 9:38 a.m. in New York.
‘Better Games’
“This is a CEO who has the authority to shake things up, and reducing the executive ranks also suggests there may be further downsizing,” said Colin Sebastian(opens in a new tab), an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. “Zynga won’t be truly right-sized until they demonstrate improving product performance, so let’s hope these changes result in better games.”
King.com, developer of Candy Crush Saga, reached 150.4 million monthly users on Facebook in June, surpassing Zynga, according to online tracker AppData(opens in a new tab), ending Zynga’s five-year reign as the top game maker on the social-networking service.
Ko, who spent a decade at Yahoo(opens in a new tab) before joining Zynga, was promoted to COO last November following a previous reorganization led by Pincus.

Per the complaint, Zynga stated that Bang With Friends selected its name "for its casual sex matchmaking app with Zynga’s game trademarks fully in mind.”
[seealso slug="hot-indie-games/"]
Since Zynga launched Words With Friends in 2009, it has spawned a variety of popular Facebook games, such as Mafia Wars and FarmVille, in addition to its "with Friends" games.
Bang With Friends didn't register its Internet domain name until last year.
Zynga is seeking a court order which would ban the company from using the name Bang with Friends and request payment for unspecified damages.

How?
The "365 Days of ZZ Ward" app(opens in a new tab) uses Facebook's Open Graph to browse users' Facebook activity and plot their ZZ Ward-tagged status updates, photos and videos.
The moments will be displayed on an interactive timeline, and fans' social participation with the experience will unlock exclusive music content. At launch, people will be able to earn access to four videos and a free MP3 download of an unreleased song.
"The app will actually get better over time as more fans connect to it and new ZZ content is added," Brian Ressler, director of digital marketing at Disney Music Group, told Mashable. The app will add new unlockable content every three weeks or so.

ZZ Ward teased the app in a tweet earlier this week with her song "365 Days":

Zzz. Zzz-zzz-zzz-zzz. That’s the sound of your phone buzzing over and over again when you get unexpectedly slapped onto a group text chain.
