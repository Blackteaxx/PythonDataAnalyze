More accurately, the question is incorrect.  A servo motor can still be a DC motor. The majority of servo motors are in fact DC motors.  The requirement for a DC (or any type) motor to be a servo is some form of feedback to provide positional information. This can be as simple as an encoder, or a resolver , or some other means to tell where the shaft, or something it is connected to is positioned. Either absolutely, or relatively.   A servo motor can be any type of motor. DC brushed, DC brushless, stepper, AC, etc..  The more appropriate question would be ""What is a servo motor"" or ""When does a DC motor become a servo motor"".   Actually, the motor itself never becomes a ""servo"" motor at all.  Its the system as a whole that is a ""servo"" , not the motor.  It is just referred to as such ,as motors with positional feedback are typically used in servo systems , and should be thought of more as ""Motor used in a servo system""",2,consid video intend allow peopl take away knowledg regard question must inform understand dc vs servo motor incorrect accur question incorrect servo motor still dc motor major servo motor fact dc motor requir dc type motor servo form feedback provid posit inform simpl encod resolv mean tell shaft someth connect posit either absolut rel servo motor type motor dc brush dc brushless stepper ac etc appropri question would servo motor dc motor becom servo motor actual motor never becom servo motor system whole servo motor refer motor posit feedback typic use servo system thought motor use servo system,1.0,228,0.447,-1.15803304,0.60177623,0.06028343
